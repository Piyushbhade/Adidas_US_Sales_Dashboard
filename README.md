1) **Low online sales presence:** Adidas' online sales presence in the US market is relatively low. In 2020, online sales accounted for only 3% of Adidas' total sales in the US market. This suggests that Adidas is not fully capitalizing on the growing trend of online shopping in the US market.
2) **Unbalanced sales growth:** Adidas' sales growth has been uneven across product categories. In 2021, the sales of Men's Street Footwear grew by 20%, while the sales of Women's Apparel grew by only 5%. This suggests that Adidas is not promoting its products evenly across all product categories.
3) **Low sales margin in offline stores:** Adidas' sales margin in offline stores is relatively low. In 2021, the average sales margin in offline stores was 30%, while the average sales margin in online stores was 70%. This suggests that Adidas is not getting the most out of its offline stores.
4) **Low sales in the South region**: Adidas' sales in the South region are relatively low. In 2021, the sales in the South region accounted for only 2% of Adidas' total sales in the US market. This suggests that Adidas is not fully capturing the potential of the South region market.
